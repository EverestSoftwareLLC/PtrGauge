# PtrGauge
A simple HTML5/Javascript "pointer" gauge (triangle) with a few features and no dependencies.

Gauge can be vertical or horizontal.
The pointer from one “side” can be mirrored to the opposite side.
A line can be drawn between the two pointers.

The included html file demonstrates the gauge.
